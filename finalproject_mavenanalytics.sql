1.	I would like to get a better understanding of all of the inventory that would come along with the business. 
Please pull together a list of each inventory item you have stocked, including the store_id number, 
the inventory_id, the name of the film, the filmâ€™s rating, its rental rate and replacement cost.

SELECT
inventory.store_id,
inventory.inventory_id,
film.title,
film.rating,
film.rental_rate,
film.replacement_cost
FROM inventory
	INNER JOIN film
    ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
